Files :

For tweet ids refer serial no of tweets in data_HTC.csv
Cluster_Tweets_5.csv : Clusterwise Tweets eg : ith line is 2,3,56,78 (tweet ids of the tweets in the ith cluster) (Kmeans clustering K=5)
Top100_K_means_5.csv : Top 100 K means tweets with K=5
Tweetwise cluster k5.csv : Tweetwise cluster nos. for KMeans K=5  ith line is 3 => tweet with id i is in cluster 3

2. BY ranking Tweets on Basis of BM25 term scoring method, tweet length, similarity index

3.Greedy method involving covering all aspects
